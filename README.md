## üåü Key Projects

### [A website showcasing my photographic journey](https://github.com/Kelaven/SPproject)

This is my favorite project because it highlights my hobby as an amateur photographer specializing in portraits and landscapes. The website features extensive front-end work, including creative design and the use of tools like GSAP for animations. On the back-end, it is built with PHP and includes a dashboard accessible to the administrator. The site supports CRUD operations, account creation, and allows users to write comments in secure galleries. This project beautifully combines my passion for photography with my web development skills.
