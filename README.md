## 🌟 Key Projects

### [A website showcasing my photographic journey](https://github.com/Kelaven/SPproject)

This is my favorite project because it highlights my hobby as an amateur photographer specializing in portraits and landscapes. The website features extensive front-end work, including creative design and the use of tools like GSAP for animations. On the back-end, it is built with PHP and includes a dashboard accessible to the administrator. The site supports CRUD operations, account creation, and allows users to write comments in secure galleries. <br> This project beautifully combines my passion for photography with my web development skills.

### [Visual redesign and new website creation for a pizza maker](https://github.com/Kelaven/pizzaflo)

In this project, I revamped an artisan’s outdated website, starting from a Figma mockup to defining the brand identity, including the logo and my corporate photographies, before delivering a fully operational deployment. I worked in API mode, optimized performance, and utilized JavaScript with Vite to create modern and efficient scripts.
This project allowed me to demonstrate my skills in both design and technical development, enhancing user experience and site responsiveness.
